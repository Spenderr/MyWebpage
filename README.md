# MyWebpage

After my practices from different HTML and CSS courses, I have practiced and created a template of the first half of my examplary tourism webpage.

In the commit of "created a template of first half", I have created a heading, adjusted the elements with flexbox, added buttons and necessary images on a raw estimate to the planned spots 

The next time I worked on the website, I have added a footer, desgined them with flexbox, margins, paddings, gaps, background color, text alignmnent and other as such.

Later, the images in the middle body (midBody) have been set adaptive to the browsers size by using the flex-wrap:wrap; command in css
