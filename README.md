# MyWebpage

After my practices from different HTML and CSS courses, I have practiced and created a template of the first half of my examplary tourism webpage.

In the commit of "created a template of first half", I have created a heading, adjusted the elements with flexbox, added buttons and necessary images on a raw estimate to the planned spots
